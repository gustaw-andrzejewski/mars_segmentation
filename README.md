# üö∞ DinoMarsFormer: Semantic Segmentation of Martian Terrain

**DinoMarsFormer** is a semantic segmentation model designed for terrain classification on Mars, using a transformer-based backbone (DINOv2) paired with a custom, shallow decoder.

This project is a small showcase of my interest in the intersection of deep learning, space exploration and robotics.

## üåç Dataset: AI4Mars

* Based on imagery from the Curiosity Rover (MSL) on Mars.
* Semantic masks with 4 terrain classes:

  * **Soil**
  * **Bedrock**
  * **Sand**
  * **Big Rock**

### üßπ Decoder Options

* **ConvNeXtDecoder**: Uses depthwise convolutions, residual connections, LayerNorm, and LayerScale for efficient spatial learning.
* **MLPDecoder**: A minimal, fast projection + fusion setup using 1x1 convolutions, inspired by SegFormer.

Both decoder types are fully interchangeable and configurable via the `decoder_type` argument. The set of ViT layers used can also be customized with `selected_layers`.

## üñºÔ∏è Example Predictions

Below is an example of initial prediction results from the initial best trained model (with ConvNeXt decoder). These are early outputs and will be improved with further experiments.

## üìä Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using standard segmentation metrics such as Mean IoU (Intersection over Union) and Dice Score.

### Results on `test_min3` version of the [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gustavv-andrzejewski/ai4mars-terrain-segmentation).

| Metric             | Value     |
| ------------------|-----------|
| Accuracy           | 0.879     |
| Mean IoU           | 0.720     |
| Dice Macro         | 0.805     |
| Dice Weighted      | 0.972     |
| Generalized Dice   | 0.805     |
| **IoU: Soil**      | 0.970     |
| **GDS: Soil**      | 0.985     |
| **IoU: Bedrock**   | 0.811     |
| **GDS: Bedrock**   | 0.880     |
| **IoU: Sand**      | 0.913     |
| **GDS: Sand**      | 0.954     |
| **IoU: Big Rock**  | 0.186     |
| **GDS: Big Rock**  | 0.402     |

These results reflect the early performance of the model and provide a strong baseline for future improvement with a particular focus on the unrepresented Big Rock class.
